## Skills

In my role at M&C Saatchi, I led the creation and global deployment of digital assets for international ad campaigns. I developed streamlined workflows and collaborated closely with designers and copywriters, ensuring seamless project execution. Building client-facing web portals and managing IT infrastructure honed my technical expertise. Similarly, at Seven Worldwide, I managed production teams, fostering efficient workflows and collaborating with clients. My experience in managing complex projects and diverse teams, coupled with technical proficiency, equips me well for a software development role.


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
